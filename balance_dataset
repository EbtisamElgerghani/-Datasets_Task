import pandas as pd

#You will use the same `balance.txt` dataset used in the example Jupyter notebook. Remember to ensure it is in the same folder as this notebook.
df = pd.read_csv('balance.txt',sep=' ')

# 1. Write the code that performs the action described in the following statements.
# Select the 'Limit' and 'Rating' columns of the first five observations
first_five_observations = df.iloc[:5]
first_five_observations[['Limit','Rating']].describe()

# Select the first five observations with 4 cards
first_five_observations = df.iloc[:5]
print(first_five_observations)
four_cards = df['Cards'].head(4)
print(f"subset of 'Cards' column first 4 raws", four_cards)

# Sort the observations by 'Education'. Show users with a high education value first.
#df.sortby[:, "Education"].max()
#print(df.groupby(['Gender']).mean(numeric_only=True))
df.sort_values(by='Education',ascending=False).head()

#2. Write a short explanation in the form of a comment for the following lines of code. For example:  
```
# Selects the first 5 rows, and all of the columns for those rows.
df.iloc[:5,:]
```

# Selelct all the column for all rows.
df.iloc[:,:]

# select all rows starting from fifth row and all column which is after the fifth column 'Age' 
df.iloc[5:,5:]

# select all rows for the first column 'Balance'.
df.iloc[:,0]

# select all column from for the 10th row of the DataFrame.
df.iloc[9,:]
